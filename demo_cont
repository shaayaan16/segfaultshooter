I will start with the comparison of Software Development Processes.
Then I will tell you about my mission, my current work progress, my future plans wrt project and finally the expected outcome of the it.
I will start with the traditional software development process.

Once in a period they would integrate all the code.
Fix the bugs because of integration.
Build the code.
Test it. 
Release it to the operations team.

Jenkins : The Ci/cd server can help solve those problems :
If you look at this system, 
There are 2 developers : Here the developers can commit the code and the labour work is taken care by the Jenkins server.
